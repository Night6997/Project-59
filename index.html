        <p>Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. Studies have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity. (Gray matter is associated with muscle control, memories, perception, and spatial navigation.)I like to play a lot of games. I started playing a lot of games from august 2020.Its fun and has a lot of puzzles for me to figure out which i like.</p>

        <h3>My favorite game is minecraft.In Minecraft the goalâ€¦is to survive. Players appear in a new world and are challenged to use its resources to build shelter, find food, and craft tools to help them construct the universe they want to live in. In Survival mode, monsters, also called mobs (Minecraft lingo for mobile non-player characters), may show hostility toward you, look to steal your resources, or even attempt to kill you. It's up to you to stay alive.</h3>
